"""BUC-1614 — Parallel Pass 3 (call resolution).

Pass 3 walks the AST cache and asks each ``CallProcessor`` to resolve the
calls in one file. Resolution itself is pure (reads ``function_registry``,
``import_mapping``, ``class_inheritance``, ``rebind_registry`` — all
populated during Pass 2 and not mutated thereafter), but each resolved
call ends with a write to the shared ``IngestorProtocol``.

Profiling on Python-only fixtures (BUC-1614 spike, 2026-05-14):

    code-graph-rag (368 .py files):  Pass 2 = 6.04s, Pass 3 = 8.20s
    skillsmith     (156 .py files):  Pass 2 = 0.63s, Pass 3 = 0.97s

Pass 3 dominates by ~35–55 % on Python repos, which justifies
parallelising it ahead of Pass 2. (BUC-1614's original gate said "if
Pass 3 >= Pass 2, pivot to Pass 3" — we hit that condition.)

Strategy
--------
* ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` with ``PARSE_PARALLELISM`` workers
  (``min(cpu_count, 8)`` by default; ``1`` keeps the legacy serial path).
* Each worker gets its own ``CallProcessor`` whose ingestor is a
  ``BufferedIngestor`` — a thread-local recorder of node/relationship
  batches.
* The worker pool reads ``function_registry``, ``import_mapping``,
  ``class_inheritance`` and ``rebind_registry`` strictly read-only.
  These structures are populated entirely by Pass 2 and Pass 2.5; no
  mutation happens during Pass 3 (verified by grep — see PR notes).
* After all workers complete, a single-writer drain replays the
  buffered operations into the real ingestor in **original AST-cache
  iteration order**, preserving the deterministic write ordering the
  ingestor relies on for stable batch keying.

Tree-sitter caveat
------------------
``tree_sitter.Parser`` instances are NOT thread-safe, but Pass 3 never
reparses — it only walks already-built ``root_node`` trees from the AST
cache and creates ephemeral ``QueryCursor`` objects (which are
per-call, so worker-local by construction). No shared mutable
tree-sitter state crosses thread boundaries.
