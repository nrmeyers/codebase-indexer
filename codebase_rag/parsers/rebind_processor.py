"""BUC-1611: module-level method rebinding (Python monkey-patching).

Detects the pattern::

    # patcher.py
    from original import Widget
    from elsewhere import custom_render

    Widget.render = custom_render

After this top-level assignment, calls to ``Widget().render()`` should
resolve to ``custom_render`` rather than the original ``Widget.render``.
The vanilla call resolver does not see this rebinding, so every call site
that targets ``Widget.render`` ends up pointing at the original symbol —
producing a graph that disagrees with the language's runtime semantics.

This module walks every Python module's top-level ``assignment`` nodes
looking for the pattern ``<ClassName>.<attribute> = <expression>``,
resolves the LHS to a class qname and the RHS to a function/method qname,
and records the rebinding in a process-wide :class:`RebindRegistry`.

The :class:`~codebase_rag.parsers.call_resolver.CallResolver` consults the
registry on every Python call resolution and, when a hit exists, swaps the
candidate callee qname for the replacement.  CALLS edges that were
rerouted through a rebinding are tagged with ``resolved_via="rebound"``
(BUC-1609 reserves this value — until BUC-1609 lands, the property is
written defensively and silently dropped by ingestors that haven't
declared the column).

Scope: Python-only for v1.  TypeScript/JS class-extension patterns
(``Klass.prototype.method = ...``) are structurally different and tracked
under a separate ticket.

Resolver-order decision
-----------------------
"Latest wins" is defined as **the last assignment seen during indexing**.
Concretely:

  1. Within one module, the registry keeps the assignment with the
     highest ``line_start`` (top-to-bottom file order — what a Python
     interpreter would see).
  2. Across modules, whichever module's rebinding was registered last
     wins.  Module processing order is driven by ``GraphUpdater._process_files``,
     which walks the AST cache in discovery order — i.e. the indexer's
     filesystem-walk order.  This is *not* the Python runtime's import
     order, but it is deterministic for a given repo snapshot and
     matches the "if I open every file and read top-to-bottom, the last
     one I see wins" mental model the user is most likely to want.

Truly accurate cross-module ordering would require modeling each
module's import graph and replaying assignments in topological order —
that is out of scope for v1.  Single-module determinism plus
last-registered-wins covers the common monkey-patching pattern
(library extension code patches a stdlib symbol once at import time).
