    """Decide whether a directory should be pruned at walk time.

    This is the directory-level companion to :func:`should_skip_path`. The
    eligible-file scan must NOT descend into heavy / ignored directories
    (``node_modules``, ``.git``, nested git worktrees under ``.claude``, etc.)
    — for a local working tree these can hold tens of thousands of files and
    tens of GB, and merely enumerating + stat-ing them stalls the
    "discovering" phase long enough for the job watchdog to reap the job.

    Pruning at traversal time means those subtrees are never enumerated at
    all, so the cost is proportional to the indexed source tree rather than
    the entire on-disk working tree.

    A directory is pruned when:

    * Its basename (or any ancestor segment, relative to the repo root) is in
      :data:`constants.IGNORE_PATTERNS` — the built-in heavy/noise dir set
      (``.git``, ``node_modules``, ``.venv``, ``__pycache__``, ``dist``,
      ``build``, ``.next``, ``.turbo``, ``.cache``, ``.claude``, ``.svn``,
      ``vendor``, ``site-packages``, ...).
    * It matches a caller-supplied directory exclude in ``exclude_paths``
      (basename match, exact relative-path match, or a relative-path prefix —
      mirroring the directory cases in :func:`should_skip_path`).

    It is NOT pruned when it (or an ancestor) is explicitly whitelisted via
    ``unignore_paths`` — a ``!vendor/mylib`` style re-enable must still allow
    the walk to descend so the whitelisted files are reachable.

    Args:
        dir_path: Absolute path of the candidate directory.
        repo_path: Absolute repo root the walk is anchored at.
        exclude_paths: Caller-supplied excludes (merged ``.cgrignore`` +
            request ``exclude_paths``). Directory-style entries prune here;
            bare-filename/glob entries are file-level only and ignored here.
        unignore_paths: Whitelist that prevents pruning of a subtree.

    Returns:
        True when the walk should not descend into ``dir_path``.
